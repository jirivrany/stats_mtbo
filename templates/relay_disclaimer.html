   <h4>Disclaimer:</h4>
   <p>The relay results are usually published with names only (without the IOF ID). Therefore all the name/id pairing was done manually. Please report any mistakes you found, I will correct them gladly. </p>

<p>Names are displayed as they are currently set in the rider <a href="https://eventor.orienteering.org/Events">Eventor</a> profile. There may be some changes against the original results, such as different surname for the girls after marriage, etc. </p>

<p>And of course, the IOF rule 24.10 says "0 If a Federation is represented by two or more teams in a relay class, only the team with the better result is considered in determining the placings." So no results here for the second, third and fourth teams, sorry guys. </p>
